# Personal website

This is my personal website. I update it very infrequently. It's probably out of date.

## To do
I may or may not ever get to writing any of this.

* Use [jekyll](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker)
* Use tailwind probably?
* Add headshot
* Add bio
* Add experience
* Add services offered as a freelancer (something overall about how I have worked with small orgs and know that sometimes working to make the most of what you have has more of an impact/is a better approach than replacing it)
    * Web development: front end, full stack
    * Migrating systems
    * Org-wide usabiility strategies and style guides for external-facing sites
    * Software maintenance
    * Usability remedation: usability research, identifying and carrying out UI fixes
    * Accessibility compliance remediation (maybe a link to a blog post about why I offer this and not something else)
    * Software and software vendor analysis and comparison
    * Setting up high-impact automated tests and testing strategy
    * Technical documentation and doc strategy
* Add blog?
    * A11y resources
    * Why I love TypeScript
    * How I went from music to public interest tech, and why it totally makes sense
    * Biggest takeaways from transitioning into tech (Google things and tinker)
    * Comparison of CMSes used by federal agencies
    * End to end testing of keyboard navigation

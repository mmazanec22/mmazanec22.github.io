# Personal website

This is my personal website. I update it very infrequently. It's probably out of date.

## To do
I may or may not ever get to writing any of this.

* Add headshot
* Add bio
* Add experience
* Add services offered as a freelancer
* Add blog?
    * A11y resources
    * Why I love TypeScript
    * How I went from music to public interest tech, and why it totally makes sense
    * Biggest takeaways from transitioning into tech (Google things and tinker)
    * Comparison of CMSes used by federal agencies
    * End to end testing of keyboard navigation

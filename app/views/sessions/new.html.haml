%p If you aren't me, then logging in is not going to work.  Because I am literally the only user.  Like, I didn't even bother to make a user model.  Why would you want to create blog posts on my personal site anyway?

/ =form_tag create_session_path, method: post do
/   =text_field_tag "password"
/   =submit_tag "submit"

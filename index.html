            <p>
                Following my curiosity and my moral compass has led me on a wending path through music, teaching, and public service to arrive in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Experience with the nonprofit and public sectors led me to start a civic-project-based code-learning group with my local Code for America brigade.  I mapped the Northeast Ohio civic tech ecosystem on behalf of the Cleveland Civic Tech and Data Collaborative and wrote my master’s thesis about how technology is changing public participation in local government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before getting interested in civic tech, I lived in the Netherlands, earned a degree in trumpet performance, worked as an au pair near Barcelona, played trumpet on cruise ships, taught kindergarten, sold bicycles, joined a polka band, helped start an after-school music program in Utah, tutored a child with autism, hitch-hiked throughout Arizona, volunteered with an organization that fed the homeless, and traveled over 7,000 miles by bicycle.

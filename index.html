      <h2> Ostrich Farm Locations</h2>
      <p>
        There are approximately 345 ostrich farms in the United States.  The majority of them are in Arizona.  Ostriches hate the desert and prefer areas with more sustainable water supplies, but they do enjoy a nice vacation to the Grand Canyon every now and then.  The best way to find an ostrich farm is by hitchhiking.

    <h2>Why Ostriches</h2>
    <p>
      Ostriches are raised primarily for their eggs.  Studies have shown that eating a humongous sunny-side up ostrich egg is even better for you than slathering yourself in coconut oil and doing yoga.

    For another great resource, check out <a href="http://unitedostrichfarms.com/index.html">United Ostrich Farms</a>.  Their website is better because the navigation button is easier to find and the pictures are appropriately sized.  Also their ostrich facts are probably better researched.

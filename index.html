  There are approximately 345 ostrich farms in the United States.  The majority of them are in Arizona.  Ostriches hate the desert and prefer areas with more sustainable water use policies, but they do enjoy a nice vacation to the Grand Canyon every now and then.

  Ostriches are raised primarily for their eggs.  Studies have shown that nothing is better for brain health than a humongous sunny-side up ostrich egg with buttered toast strips.  Not even slathering yourself in coconut oil and doing yoga.

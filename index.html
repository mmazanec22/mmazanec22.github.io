            <h1>Melanie Mazanec</h1>
            <p>
                Currently setting out on a new adventure as a Digital Services Developer for the city government of Asheville, North Carolina.  Always following my curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary interest lies in ethically, transparently, and compassionately easing state and local governments into the twenty-first century.  Along the way, I hope to study collaborative governance in technical projects, security risks of using open source and free software in government, whether procurement processes can be fixed with lessons from human-centered design, what data science can teach us about economics, and other topics at the intersection of technology and public service.
            </p>

                Previously, I visualized data for a cybersecurity startup, earned a degree in trumpet performance, traveled over seven thousand miles by bicycle, and worked in several educational roles.

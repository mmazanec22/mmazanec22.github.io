                Currently a Chicago-based web developer falling in love with data visualization.  Always following my curiosity.

                My long-term interests lie in ethically, transparently, and compassionately easing state and local governments into the 21st century.  Along the way, I hope to the study collaborative governance in technical projects, security risks of using open source and free software in government, whether procurement processes can be fixed with lessons from human-centered design, what data science can teach us about economics, and other topics at the intersection of technology and public service.
            </p>

                Before getting interested in civic tech, I earned a degree in music, lived in the Netherlands, worked as an au pair near Barcelona, played trumpet on cruise ships, taught kindergarten, sold bicycles, joined a polka band, helped start an after-school music program in Utah, tutored a child with autism, hitch-hiked throughout Arizona, and traveled over 7,000 miles by bicycle.
